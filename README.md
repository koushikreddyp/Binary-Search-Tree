# Implementation of Binary Search Tree

This project focuses on implementing a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** data structure in C++. The BST class includes operations such as :
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)


## Overview

The project "Implementation of Binary Search Tree" focuses on creating a binary search tree data structure in C++ and implementing various operations like insertion, deletion, and searching on the tree.

## Features & Functionalities

Designed a C++ class BinarySearchTree to represent the BST.

Implemented methods for insertion (insert), deletion (remove), searching (search), and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).

Insertion Operation:
Allows inserting a new node into the BST while maintaining its properties 
(left child < parent < right child).

Deletion Operation:
Supports deletion of a node from the BST based on different cases: node has no children, node has one child, and node has two children.

Search Operation:
Enables searching for a key in the BST to determine if it exists in the tree.

## Technology Used

- Programming Language: C++
> A powerful and efficient programming language ideal for system software and performance-critical applications.
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
> A lightweight yet feature-rich code editor with robust support for various programming languages, including powerful tools for C++ development.

## How to Run the Program
### Prerequisites
To run this program on your computer, you need: - 
**C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
Recommended: `g++` for Unix/Linux, `MinGW` for Windows, or `Xcode` for macOS.
 - **IDE (Optional):** An Integrated Development Environment like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or any text editor with compiler integration. 
### Getting Started
 1. **Clone the Repository:**
 > git clone [https://github.com/koushikreddyp/Binary-Search-Tree]
 2. **Compile the Program:**
 - **Unix/Linux/macOS:** Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. ```bash g++ main.cpp BinarySearchTree.cpp -o bst ``` 
 - **Windows (MinGW):** Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project directory. ```bash g++ main.cpp BinarySearchTree.cpp -o bst.exe ``` 
 
 3. **Run the Program:** 
 - **Unix/Linux/macOS:** ```bash ./bst ``` 
 - **Windows:** ```bash bst.exe ``` 
 
 ### Usage 
 Once the program is running, you can interact with the Binary Search Tree through a command-line interface (CLI). 
 The program allows you to: 
 - Insert nodes into the BST 
 - Delete nodes from the BST 
 - Search for a node in the BST 
 - Traverse the BST (inorder, preorder, postorder) 
 
 Follow the on-screen instructions to perform these operations. 
### Example
 
 Binary Search Tree Operations: 
 1. Insert 
 2. Delete 
 3. Search 
 4. Traverse (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder) 
 5. Exit 
 >Enter your choice: 1
>Enter value to insert: 50
>BST after insertion: 50
>Enter your choice: 1
>Enter value to insert: 30
>BST after insertion: 50 / 30
... (continue with other operations as needed) 

## Conclusion

The "Implementation of Binary Search Tree" project showcases foundational data structures and operations in computer science, implemented in C++. It provides a comprehensive implementation of a binary search tree with essential operations.
